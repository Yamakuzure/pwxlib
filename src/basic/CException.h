  * @brief Declaration of CException, a tracing exception
  *
  * CException serves the purpose of a base class that allows to trace the
  * path an exception takes until it is caught. To enable the tracing the
  * macros (see pwx/general/pwx_macros.h) PWX_THROW and PWX_THROW_FURTHER have
  * to be used.
