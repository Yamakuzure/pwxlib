List of current TODOs
---------------------

pwxLib :
----------------------------------
- Elevate to C++11 Standard
  - Add Lambdas where applicable
  - Switch to new Initialization where applicable
  - Replace CRITICAL_SECTION and pthreads with C++ threads
  -> Latest Version for the full change: 0.8.9999

- Add threading functions and a class wrapper.

- Add the possibility to compile a link library instead of enforcing
  JBoH. This will need quite some restructuring.
  -> It is the next major change and thus marking version 0.9

- Re-add pwxVector3D
  This was the first part of the PrydeWorX Library, but unfortunately it
  wasn't designed for inclusion in a JBoH Library and got removed. To re-
  add it it has to be rewritten from scratch. (But of course the math can
  be reused ;-)
  pwxVector3D organizes Vector 3D models consisting of dots, lines and
  elipses and supports moving, rotating and morphing in 3D space, plus
  calculating the coordinates into 2D for easier display. The latter is
  supported by a method to loop through all components of an object ordered
  by their current camera distance.
  -> This being the last component for the first full version marks version
     1.0

CFH (CCnfFileHandler.h) :
----------------------------------
nothing right now


MRF (CMemRingFactory.h) :
----------------------------------
- Add typedefs for more readable, though longer, names
- Add a wrapper to use TMemRing like a Hash/Associative Array.
- Add a wrapper to use TMemRing as a Stack.
- Add a wrapper to use TMemRing as a Queue.


RNG (CRandom.h) :
----------------------------------
- Add hash() functions for [C-]Strings


SCT (CSinCosTables.h) :
----------------------------------
nothing right now


tools/getrn (getRandomName) :
----------------------------------
nothing right now


tools/gravMat :
----------------------------------
- Add a GUI-free console mode
- Add rendering directly into videos using ffmpeg
- ETA disabled for now, write a new ETA module. A new component perhaps?


tools/mkst (makeSimplexTexture) :
----------------------------------
- add sequence generators to produce n textures in batch mode
