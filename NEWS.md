* The API has been completely overhauled and should now have reached its final form.
* From here on the API may be extended, but changes shall be rare and removals non-existent.
* Thread safety has been greatly improved, and gcc-9.2.0 ThreadSanitizer does not find anything any more in test_lib.
* The API documentation, although not fully complete, yet, has been overhauled and fixed.
* Many fixes, additions and optimizations are here in this release.
* However, the automatic micro-locking is (intentionally) overdoing right now, but this will be fixed for the next
  release.
